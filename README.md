## About

In April 2024 Dubai experienced the craziest weather it has seen in 75+ years. The city experienced intense winds and rain. If you weren't lucky enough to be in Dubai for Token2049 and ETHDubai then experience the next best thing with the ETH Dubai survival Simulator!

A take on Flappy Bird - Survival Simulator puts you in the shoes of a plucky Emirates plane navigating between the skyscrapers of Dubai and the storms battering the city.

Experience winds, rain and compete to get the high score.

The game is supported on Sepolia / XDC and Morph.

Players should deplosit 0.01 ETH / TXDC and the highest scoring player will get the entire prize pool periodically.
